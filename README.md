This is where I started my Portfolio Building while taking my Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub.

I have learnt several things, ranging from MS Excel to SQL, and now to Portfolio Building

## PROJECT TOPIC: E Commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive Data Analysis of an e-commerce platform’s sales data to identify key trends, patterns, and business insights. The analysis focuses on customer behavior, product performance, seasonal fluctuations, and regional sales distribution. Results from this analysis support data-driven decisions in areas such as marketing strategy, inventory planning, and customer engagement.

### Data Sources
The primary source of data in this project represents simulated transactional data from an e-commerce platform. It contains detailed information on customer orders, including order IDs, dates, customer demographics, product categories, regions, quantities, sales, discounts, and profit margins. This data structure reflects typical business operations and provides a solid foundation for analyzing sales trends, gaining insights into customer behavior, and evaluating performance across various dimensions.

### Tools Used

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparation, we perform the following actions;
